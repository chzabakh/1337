(XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected
into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker
uses a web application to send malicious code.



To protect against XSS attacks, make sure that any dynamic content
coming from the HTTP request cannot be used to inject JavaScript on a page.

-Escape Dynamic Content

-Whitelist Values

-Implement a Content-Security Policy
